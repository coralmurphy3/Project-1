# Comparing Depression Rates In New York City and State
## Goal 
### Compare the self-reported depression diagnoses in New York City boroughs and how they differ from other counties in the state.
### The webpage for the project can be found [here](https://coralmurphy3.github.io/Project-1/). 
## Findings
### In New York City, the highest percentage of depression diagnoses was in Manhattan, with about 19 percent of residents reporting they’ve been diagnosed with depression.
## Summary of data collection process 
### The data comes from a recently-published (June 2023) CDC report, where respondents were classified as having depression if they responded “yes” to the question, “Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told you that you had a depressive disorder, including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression?” 
### I downloaded the raw data found in the website [here](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7224a1.htm?s_cid=mm7224a1_w#F1_down). 
## Overview of the data analysis process
### I transfered the data to [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MfN2JNYa44BlJZ4r9wO-F_DumepJIrg7sPe289mDIVU/edit#gid=2013756983) and synched it with Datawrapper to make the charts. I cleaned the data to just reveal the counties I was analyzing, which were Bronx, Richmond, Kings, New York, and Queens. 
## New skills and approaches
### I learned the basics in formatting a website using HTML and creating a GitHub repository. What I most found challenging was using Datawrapper and extracting the New York City data I wanted to use for the visualizations.
### If I had more time, I would practice extracting the data in Visual Studio Code, as well as create visualizations in Jupyter Notebook.
