# Comparing Depression Rates In New York City and State
## Goal 
### Compare the self-reported depression diagnoses in New York City boroughs and how they differ from other counties in the state.
## Findings
### In New York City, the highest percentage of depression diagnoses was in Manhattan, with about 19 percent of residents reporting they’ve been diagnosed with depression.
## Summary of data collection process 
### The data comes from a recently-published (June 2023) CDC report, where respondents were classified as having depression if they responded “yes” to the question, “Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told you that you had a depressive disorder, including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression?” 
### I downloaded the raw data found in the website [here](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7224a1.htm?s_cid=mm7224a1_w#F1_down). 
### Summary of the data collection process, with links
### Overview of the data analysis process
### A section about what new skills, approaches, etc you used, or where you grew the most during the project
### A section about things you tried to do or wanted to do but did not have the skills/time (but if you have more time you might do)
